The PS files need to be converted to PDF first.

I use ghostscript for this. I go the the directorty and type:

```ps2pdf -dNOSAFER -sPAPERSIZE=a4```

The resulting PDF can be loaded into the tool inkscape to which I have installed a plug-in to export to Silhouette Portrait. I usually load only one page at the time.

I cut them by choosing: Extensions &rarr; Export &rarr; Send to Silhouette ...

The last page usually shows me the result of the faces when they are exported from Orbitit.

Adjustments can be if needed. To scale up or down the pieces, one can update the variable scaling_size. It tried to make sure that this also keeps the (relative) position more or less the same, but this is in general unverified.
